## ⛩️ What is the Billionaire Dojo? ⛩️  
Now that Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg wanted to fight each other in a cage match, we can take it pretty much for granted that we all live in a strange computer simulation.   
   
But hey, what's stopping us from making the simulation timeline even more weird? What if not just Elon and Zuck, but other famous tech CEOs would also fight each other? Now we can all make this our own reality. Welcome to the Billionaire Dojo, fighter!   
   
Billionaire Dojo is a blockchain-based game where tech billionaires can be minted as NFTs and entered into matches against each other.   

Our goal is to create a fun game that makes people laugh and takes their minds off all the bullshit that's happening in the world right now at least for a little while. We live on <b>the Lukso blockchain</b>, the perfect ecosystem for fun-loving projects tapping into the cultural zeitgeist of our time. 

## 🐲 Game mechanics 🐲   
Each billionaire represents a team (i.e. Team Elon, Team Zuck, etc.), and the game's goal is to take the balance of other teams and make your team more wealthy. Other teams can also be ousted from the game if all their players' balance goes down to zero. In the end, there can be only one.

### 📈 The Stats
When you mint your billionaire, it will get 5 stats and a balance. All stats range between 1 and 100.    

💸 <b>Balance</b>: All new players start with 1000 balance. You put some amount of the player's balance on the line each time you fight another player.    
💰 <b>Wealth</b>: How wealthy your player is. These are billionaires, so expect this to be high for most players.    
💪 <b>Strength</b>: This value is totally random and can be anywhere in the range.    
🥵 <b>Stamina</b>: This value is totally random and can be anywhere in the range.    
😏 <b>Charisma</b>: This value is totally random and can be anywhere in the range.    
🤗 <b>Empathy</b>: Well... don't expect your player's empathy to be sky-high. So if you happen to mint a player with high empathy hold on to it!     

### The Octagon   
This is where the fighting takes place. The first thing players do here is select the level they want to play on.   

The Octagon has 3 levels:
